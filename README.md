# 3d-model-tracking
An experiment using the track.js library to move inside the environment of an STL file.
### To run the application:
* Clone it from the repo and make sure to open index.html in firefox because chrome has higher XMLHTTPRequest security settings.
* It will ask you if want to enable the camera, press yes.
* Find something magenta colored
* Wave it around the camera and move around inside the 3d model
* A video demo of the project can be found here: [VIDEO](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2LFmH6cFdOmWnVFUE01ZmpoaDQ/view?usp=sharing)
