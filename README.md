# 3d-model-tracking
An experiment using the track.js library to move inside the environment of an STL.
###If you're interested in running the application:
*Clone it from the repo and make sure to open index.html in firefox because chrome has higher XMLHTTPRequest security settings. 
*It will ask you if want to enable the camera, press yes.
*Find something magenta colored
*Wave it around the camera and move around inside the 3d model
